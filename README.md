## Overview 
In this project, I will be analyzing Bikesharing data using Python and Tableau in order to create a proposal for Des Moines investors. A bike trip analysis is created with the following visualizations: 
- The length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
- The number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
- The number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
