## Overview 
In this project, I will be analyzing NYC Bikesharing data using Python and Tableau in order to create a proposal for Des Moines investors. A bike trip analysis is created with the following visualizations: 
- The length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
- The number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
- The number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

## Results 

Using the visualizations in the Tableau Story, here are the results of each visualization:

Younger bike users tend to take longer bike rides than older ones


## Summary 

The data shows high activity of bike sharing in NYC during August. Most of this activity is clustered around the island of Manhattan by male riders who take these bikes early in the morning and during the evening rush hours. This means that Citi Bike can be used by people who are looking for an alternative to public transportation. 

For future analysis: 
- Looking at monthly trends in bikeshare data
- Perhaps including weather data to find what effect it may have on rides
